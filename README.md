# 🧪 QA Automation for Ingredient Validation

This project automates **quality assurance checks** for ingredient data across multilingual Brand websites.  
It ensures ingredient lists are complete, correctly localized, and consistent across markets.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Fetches ingredient data from a **Google Drive Excel library**  using SheetJS library 
- Compares website content with the reference list to detect:
  - Missing or mismatched ingredients  
  - Localization or spelling inconsistencies  
  - Formatting or display errors  
- Displays results directly in the browser for quick review

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The script reads the ingredient reference file stored in Google Drive  
2. It scans the live or staging website content  
3. Discrepancies are reported in a visual panel for quick review and correction
